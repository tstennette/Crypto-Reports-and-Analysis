2021-06-13 01:49:00,TheCryptoLark,5 - The so called triple halving is coming as part of the ETH 2.0 upgrade. This will reduce ETH inflation from 4.5% to around 0.5% which is a dramatic economic shift.
2021-06-13 01:49:00,TheCryptoLark,"4 - The home of defi is ETH, and while competitor chains are starting to gain market share the best applications with the deepest liquidity remain on ETH. This creates a constant demand for the ETH asset to interact with these in demand apps."
2021-06-13 01:49:00,TheCryptoLark,6 - Increasingly big money is choosing ETH as an investment due to the innovational nature of the asset and the staking rewards.
2021-06-13 01:49:00,TheCryptoLark,"7 - Ethereum is quickly becoming the premiere internet bond. Holding ETH gives you exposure to everything happening on ETH, defi, gaming, nfts, ID, etc. Plus rewards at 7% APY that generate more of themselves."
2021-06-13 01:48:00,TheCryptoLark,3 - Ethereum 2.0 is still coming and it will dramatically increase scaling via network sharding and make applications more robust with Web Assembly.
2021-06-13 01:48:00,TheCryptoLark,2 - EIP 1559 will introduce fee burning which will overtime start to reduce the supply of ETH. This delflationary force will make ETH more scarce.
