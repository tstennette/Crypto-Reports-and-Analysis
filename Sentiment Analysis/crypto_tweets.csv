And the second crucial support is the ~$29000-$32000 area (black horizontal &amp; green box)

If a Death Cross occurs and #BTC loses these two crucial support areas shortly after...

Then the Death Cross would likely be validated and $BTC would see further downside

#Bitcoin https://t.co/50Gk7B7hsj"
2021-06-18 12:26:52,rektcapital,"6.

That being said, it's important to understand that the DC is only one signal

If a DC occurs then #BTC would need to breakdown from two crucial support areas to validate it

One of them is the Weekly Higher Low (black) which has spanned the entirety of 2021

#Crypto #Bitcoin https://t.co/7AiaCQlKsF"
2021-06-18 12:26:51,rektcapital,"5. 

At this rate, the DC will occur later this month

So what could happen when #BTC performs its upcoming Death Cross?

Since $BTC has crashed -54% already...

BTC could crash an extra -54%, should the historical symmetry hold

This would result in a ~$18,000 #Bitcoin

2021-06-18 12:26:49,rektcapital,"4. 

Of course, a few DCs that occurred during late 2019 &amp; early 2020 didn't precede much downside

In fact, the March 2020 DC marked out the generational bottom for #BTC

When $BTC peaked in June 2019, price had already dropped by -53% before the Death Cross
